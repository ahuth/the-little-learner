// The book says line is a "parameterized" function because it takes "parameters" after its
// arguments. In this case, `x` is an argument, while `slope` and `b` are parameters.
//
// Also apparently for a given `x` and its `y`, we can figure out what `slope` and `b` are.
//
// Finding the parameters for a "dataset" (in this case pairs of xs and ys) is "learning" ğŸ¤¯.
